Make folder "poisoning":
mkdir poisoning

Unzip:
unzip ML_Poisoning.zip

Create environments:
conda create --name ADM --file ADM_spec_file.txt
conda create --name DIFF --file DIFF_spec_file.txt

Update git (might need specific access from Mathias):
cd ML_Poisoning/Diffusion_GAN
git pull 
cd ../DDPM_IP
git pull

Run training:
By default, it runs all 3 (clean and poison 1 + poison 2).
To only run a single, comment (put # first) before the "setup_single" commands at the bottom (they are in order: clean, poison 1, poison 2)
To only run with specific array indexes, copy the "ARRAY=1-10" and "export SBATCH_ARRAY_INX=$ARRAY, and alter "1-10" to the indexes you want. X-Y for ranges, and X,Y for individual indexes
